# sirc
Simple IRC Client

My attempt at building a command line IRC client

I haven't really used IRC very much, and I don't know very much about it, but i'll see how it goes.

## Usage

Start each command with ```/```

```
join <channel>         - join a channel
leave                  - leave the current channel
msg <nick> <message>   - send a private message
next                   - go to next tab
prev                   - go to previous tab
```
